          <div id="aboutme">
              <p>I am a dancer for the past 5 years. I have been dancing different genres such as modern dance, hip hop, jazz and malay dance. It helps me to express my feelings and thoughts through a song without speaking, hence I really enjoy dancing regardless of the music. I love doing sports as well. I commonly play basketball, badminton, volleyball and cycling during my free time with family or friends. It starts to form a habit since I am 11 years old which sustains till now.</p>
