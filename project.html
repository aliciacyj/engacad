             </div>
             <div id="html">
               <p>This is my first time trying out HTML. I learnt how to use basic html functions from a 12 minutes video. There are many text editors apps to download and I chose atom as my default text editor. It is more convenient to use atom if you are using github as well.</p>

             <div id="css">
               <p>CSS is to design the webpage. There are many different things you can use to make a webpage look presentable. As such, I tend to use different colours to make it nicer and more colorful to attract the reader attention. It is important to have a design in anything because no one will want to look at something that is very plain and no uniqueness. Also, we are able to shift the parts around to what we want to be in the webpage.</p>

               <h2>using markdown</h2>
             </div>
             <div id="markdown">
               <p>It is more convenient and easier to use markdown than html. However, I will still prefer using html way.</p>

             <div id="githubtitle">
               <h2>using github</h2>
             </div>
             <div id="github">
               <p>After downloading github, to set up a site, we are supposed to create a respository and we can upload the files in there. The username and respository are used behind the www.github.com when access the files. It is great to learn this as it is quite convenient for me to put files inside and access them in a easier way.</p>

             <div id="gittitle">
               <h2>using git</h2>
             </div>
             <div id="git">
               <p>It was quite hard for me to understand git at first but after some time of learning, I managed to understand better and really tried to understand the logic and process.</p>

               <img src="keychainirl.jpg" width="200px"/>
               <p>Since I never have experience using fusion 360 before, it is definitely a great try for me to learn new things along the way. When I first time tried this software, I needed to make a keychain as shown above to print it out. At first it was hard for me to use the functions in fusion 360 but after some time, I am more used to it already.</p>

               <div id="box">
                 <img src="box.png" width="300px"/>
                 <p>The first design I did is a simple box. In order to make it like a box, I used the method of cutting and joining some slots of every side of the box to connect them, so in real life, they are in a piece and it will be stable.</p>

               <img src="backshirtirl.jpeg" width="150px"/>
               <p>First time printing own shirt. My favourite animal is pig so I took some images and design in my own way, followed by searching a quote to encourage myself. The experience is great because people can have their own ideas and design the way they want according to their likes.</p>
